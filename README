In this I will explain how to run this project on your linux system.

First of all we have to install all the required libraries in your system for python.
Open your terminal through Ctr+Alt+T.
Now you need to install pip(command:sudu apt-get install pip(in ubuntu)) in your system then through that you can install all the python libraries.

List of libraries:
1. os (it will already present in your system)
2. sqlite3 (command: sudo pip install sqlite3)
3. json (maybe present in our system)
4. time (will be presenyt in your system)
5. hashlib (command: sudo pip install hashlib)
6. collections (command: sudo pip install collections)
7. selenium (check google once how to install selenium in linux for python,but the command should be : sudo pip install selenium)
8. requests (command: pip install requests)
9. io (command:pip install io)

Once you installed all the libraries now it time to run the project.

STEPS:

1.open your terminal.
2.change your directory by cd command to the project directory.
3.now enter command: python main.py
4.after this it will ask youo for the path of the project directory. Enter the path like this : /home/your-username/where-the-project-is-present
5.after enter it will ask for the moilla firefox profile path. The mozilla folder is hidden so you you have to go to views and click on show    hidden folders in your home directory.The path looks like this : /home/your-username/.mozilla/firefox/your-firefox-profile . It has .default in the folder name
6.VOILA! now it will automatically check for any malware when you download any file.

DOUBTS:
1.whenever you download some file, after some time extra browser window will open. NO WORRIES it will check for vruses on virus total websites
2.you can check the result of that file after 5 min approx
3.only file that are less than 4 MB will be checked

CONFIGURATION:
1.According to your internet speed you can change some values in the files
 IF you have HIGH INTERNET SPEED
 # like in copy_file.py you can change time.sleep(90) to time.sleep(60) , its for DOWNLOADING time of your name any file thats why filesize restrictions
 # the SIZE OF FILES that should be checked can be changed in copy_file.py  if int(dic['fileSize'])<=4000000: toif int(dic['fileSize'])<=6000000:  now the file size checked is 6MB
 # for UPLOADING till 4MB the  time alloted is 120 seconds you can change it in selenium1.py time.sleep(120) to time.sleep(90)

 IF you have LOW INTERNET SPEED
 #then dont change the configuration but instead you can increase the values like above in which we decrease the time values.
